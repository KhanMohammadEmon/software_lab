##  Introduction:
In this project, we will implement a revolutionary project to make campus life easier. Our mobile app will do several tasks that will solve multiple problems that are linked to campus life. For example, the course scheduling feature will help students do the course routine easily and without hassle. Our mobile app will notify users, which will help them remember the important task. We are going to use Firebase for handling data. For security purposes, we are going to use authentication. 

## Features :
- Exam Routine / Room No Show
- Class Time / Room No extracted from the user manually or automatically
- Qus Bank with a better filtering system
- Chatbot for queries
- Web Scraping for Notices

## Basic Data Flow:
1. A user interacts with the Flutter front end, triggering a request.
2. The front end communicates with the Firebase backend through Firebase SDKs and APIs.
3. Firebase services handle the request, including authentication using Firebase Authentication.
4. Firebase Firestore replaces the MongoDB database for data storage and retrieval.
5. The serverless architecture of Firebase manages backend operations, eliminating the need for explicit microservices.
6. Containerization is not required as Firebase handles deployment and scaling automatically, ensuring consistency across different environments within the Firebase platform.
This adapted tech stack and architecture align with Flutter and Firebase, providing a robust and scalable foundation for our project's goals.


## Future Plan:
We plan to implement a video lecture library inside our app for the learning platform

## About Me
***
It is a long **established fact that** a reader will be distracted by *the readable content of* a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, _content here_', **_ making it look like _** readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
